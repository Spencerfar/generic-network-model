This code simulates a generic network model of aging (GNM). If you publish with this, please cite one for both of Farrell et al. "Network model of human aging: Frailty limits and information measures" 2016, https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.052409, and/or Farrell et al. "Probing the network structure of health deficits in human aging" 2018, https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.032302.

Note: originally this code was written in C++, but here it is in Python for simplicity (and is much slower than C++ version).
